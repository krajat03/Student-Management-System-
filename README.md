# Student-Management-System-

This Java program implements a Student Management System using the Scanner class for input and the Vector class for dynamic storage.
The Student class encapsulates student details, including name, class, roll number, parent's names, address, and contact number. It provides two methods: input() for taking user input and output() for displaying stored information. 
The StudentManagementSystem class manages students through an interactive loop where users can add new students, retrieve details by class and roll number, delete records, or exit the program.
A Vector<Student> list stores student objects dynamically, allowing efficient insertion and deletion. The program ensures proper user interaction by checking for empty lists and validating searches before displaying or modifying records. The flow of execution is controlled using a switch statement that guides users through various functionalities, maintaining structured and user-friendly output.
